## Partitioning Configuration

Use a spreadsheet. Don't make me come over there.

[Why Stacki Uses Spreadsheets](Using-Spreadsheets)

Like a storage controller config, partitioning config done in a spreadsheet is a **Stacki best practice.** You can see it, play with it, and validate your partition config when it's loaded.

> **Please note:** Partitioning is done in parallel. Stacki is the only installer that does this.

## Spreadsheet

The configuration of disk partitions can be specified in a
spreadsheet with the following columns:

1. **Name**. A host name, appliance type or 'global'.
1. **Device**. The Linux disk device name (e.g., ``sda``, ``sdb``).
1. **Mountpoint**. Where the partition should be mounted on the file system.
1. **Size**. The size of the partition in megabytes. '0' will instruct the installer to use the remaining available space of the device.
1. **Type**. How the partition should be formatted (e.g., xfs, swap).
1. **Options**. Free form string of options that can be used to create a partition.

An example spreadsheet is shown below.

> **Note**:  Example spreadsheets for partitioning configuration are also available on your frontend in `/opt/stack/share/examples/spreadsheets`. Look for files with 'partition' in the name.

| Name        | Device   | Mountpoint | Size  | Type     | Options               |
|:------------|:---------|:-----------|:------|:---------|:----------------------|
| global      | sda      | biosboot   | 1     | biosboot |                       |
|             | sda      | /          | 50000 | ext4     |                       |
|             | sda      | /var       | 80000 | ext4     |                       |
|             | sda      | swap       | 16000 | swap     |                       |
|             | sda      | /scratch   | 0     | xfs      |                       |
| backend     | sda      | biosboot   | 1     | biosboot |                       |
|             | sda      | /          | 50000 | ext4     |                       |
|             | sda      | /var       | 10000 | ext4     |                       |
|             | sda      | swap       | 16000 | swap     |                       |
|             | sda      | /scratch   | 1     | xfs      | --grow --maxsize=4000 |
|             | sdb      | /hadoop01  | 0     | xfs      |                       |
|             | sdc      | /hadoop02  | 0     | xfs      |                       |
| backend-0-1 | sda      | biosboot   | 1     | biosboot |                       |
|             | sda      | /          | 10000 | ext4     |                       |
|             | sda      | swap       | 1000  | swap     |                       |
|             | sdb      | pv.01      | 8000  | lvm      |                       |
|             | pv.01    | volgrp01   | 6000  | volgroup |                       |
|             | volgrp01 | /extra     | 4000  | ext4     | --name=extra          |


The _Name_ column can contain a specific host name (e.g., _backend-0-0_), an
Appliance type (e.g., _backend_) or it can be set to _global_.  

In the sample spreadsheet, we see the default configuration (_global_) is to
only configure the partitions for the first disk (``sda``).
The root partition ``/`` is an ext4 partition and it is 50 GB.
The ``/var`` partition is an ext4 partition and it is 80 GB.
The ``swap`` partition is 16 GB.
Lastly, ``/scratch`` is an xfs partition and it will be the remainder of ``sda``.

The default configuration for all backends, _backend_, has a similar configuration for ``sda`` as the _global_ configuration except for the ``/scratch`` partition. The maximum size of ``/scratch`` partition is set to 1 GB via the Options column.
Additionally, ``sdb`` and ``sdc`` will be configured for all _backends_ as single partitions that span the entire disk.

> **Note:** a "biosboot" partition must exist for any system disk on a CentOS/RHEL 7.x system. Make sure you define this.


## LVM

Stacki supports specifying LVM configuration via a spreadsheet. **lvm**, **volgroup** are keywords that indicate that the partition needs to be setup via LVM. In the configuration for ``backend-0-1``,
``pv.01`` is configured as a physical volume on ``sdb`` with size as 8GB.
``volgrp01`` is a volgroup comprising of ``pv.01``. ``/extra`` is mounted as an lvm partition on volgroup ``volgrp01``.

## Raid

Software raid can also be defined easily in a partition file. Do this instead of the dumb software RAID defined in the hardware BIOS your equally cheap and dumb white box or bottom of the line A-list vendor box came with.

| NAME    | DEVICE | MOUNTPOINT     | SIZE  | TYPE     | OPTIONS                       |
|:--------|:-------|:---------------|:------|:---------|:------------------------------|

> **Note:** The 'biosboot' partition on both of the physical drives.


When you are finished editing your spreadsheet, save it as a CSV file, then copy the CSV file to your frontend.

Then, load the CSV file into the database on the frontend by executing:

```
# stack load storage partition file=partition.csv
```

You can view your storage partition configuration by executing:

```
# stack list storage partition
```

## The _nukedisks_ Attribute

A host's disk partitions will only be reconfigured if the _nukedisks_ attribute is set to _true_. On first install, all installing backend disks automatically have _nukedisks_ set to _false_. If you've added backend nodes via spreadsheet, you must set _nukedisks_ to _true_ as in the example below, before installing.

As an example, to set the _nukedisks_ attribute for host _backend-0-0_, execute:

```
# stack set host attr backend-0-0 attr=nukedisks value=true
```
For all hosts:

```
# stack set host attr a:backend attr=nukedisks value=true
```

Then, the next time _backend-0-0_ is installed, it will remove all partitions for all disks, then repartition the disks as you specified in your spreadsheet.

While a host is installing, after it partitions its disks, it will send a message to the frontend to instruct it to set the  _nukedisks_ attribute back to _false_.

This ensures that the disks will not be reconfigured on the next installation.

Its benefit is less obvious if you're using "xfs" but it's very obvious if you're still using "ext4." (Why are you still using ext4?)
