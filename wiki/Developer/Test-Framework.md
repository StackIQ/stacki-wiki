## Test Framework

Stacki ships with a full set of unit, integration, and system test-suites that our CI/CD pipeline uses to validate any code changes.

But, you can run these test-suites yourself on your local development machine, using Vagrant and Virtualbox or KVM.

Documentation about the Test Framework can be found in the Stacki codebase here: https://github.com/Teradata/stacki/blob/master/test-framework/README.md
