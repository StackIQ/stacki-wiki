## Frontend install new server

It is of course, recommended that you use the newest release when testing or building new clusters.

Download the Stackios ISO file.
[stackios-5.4-redhat7.x86_64.disk1.iso](https://github.com/Teradata/stacki/releases/download/stacki-5.4/stackios-5.4-redhat7.x86_64.disk1.iso) (MD5: *TBD*)

Burn the file to a DVD and mount it in an external or internal DVD drive or on the virtual media for the server to be installed. Installing a frontend will completely erase and reformat the hard disks in the server. So use caution when deciding which server to designate as your frontend.

A USB is the same process as using a DVD, you just have to burn the file to a USB drive and choose that at the install screen.

Boot the server with the DVD (or virtual media mounted) and the
following screen will appear after the BIOS is initialized:

![frontend_install_vbox_3](images/frontend/frontend_install_vbox_3.png)

If you don't see the above screen, go back to
the [requirements](#requirements) section and
make sure the DVD is the first entry in the boot order.

If booting from USB, choose the second option.

You can hit enter or just wait a few seconds and the Stacki
frontend installation will begin, and you will soon see the
[Installation Wizard](#installation-wizard).

## Installation Wizard

The Installation Wizard is the same for either the New or the Existing installation methods. The installation that happens after going through the wizard is either a typical CentOS/RHEL server install (New) or a set of scripts that run to create the Stacki software stack (Existing).

The Installation Wizard is now text-based, because, The 90s!

### Timezone

The first screen will appear and you will be prompted to enter your timezone:

### Network

_**Do not get this network wrong! Changing it after the fact means a RE-INSTALL of the frontend.**_

The network configuration screen allows you to set up the network that will
be used by the frontend to install backend hosts.

1. _Fully Qualified Host Name_ - Input the FQDN for the frontend.
2. Choose from the network _Devices_ to select the frontend's network interface.
3. _IP_ address of the interface.
4. _Netmask_.
5. _Gateway_.
5. _DNS Servers_ - More than one DNS Server can be entered as a comma-separated list (i.e., 8.8.8.8, 4.2.2.2, 8.8.4.4)(more than two nameservers is stupid.)

Click _Continue_ to configure the network interface.

### Password

Enter the password for the **root** account on the frontend.  This is also the root password for the backend nodes. Choose a better one than shown here.

### Choose Partition

If _Automated_ mode is selected, the installer will
repartition and reformat the first discovered hard drive
that is connected to the frontend. All other drives
connected to the frontend will be left untouched.

| Partition Name                                     | Size                   |
|:---------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|
| /                                                  | 16GB                   |
| /var                                               | 16GB                   |
| swap                                               | 1GB                    |
| /export (symbolically linked to /state/partition1) | remainder of root disk |

When using automatic partitioning, the installer repartitions
and reformats the first hard drive (e.g. _sda_) that the installer
discovers. All previous data on this drive will be erased.
All other drives will be left untouched. If you are unsure about how
the drives will be discovered in a multi-disk frontend,
select _Manual_ mode.

In _Manual_ mode, the installer brings up a partition setup
screen after the wizard exits. In this mode, specify at least 16 GB
for the root partition and a separate /export partition. The /export partition should be the largest one on the disk. You should add
a swap partition, and /var of about 16-20GB if you have made / only 16GB.

### Add Pallets

Choose the _Pallets_ you want to install.

Booting from a DVD, pallets should automatically load onto the list for you to choose.

In an Existing installation you will only see the stacki pallet - even if you have supplied the --extra-isos parameter.

In New installation with the stackios pallet you should see two pallets: the the _stacki_ and _os_ pallets to install.

If you want to add pallets from another Stacki frontend or from a webserver hosting pallet ISOs, Choose _Add Pallets_ and supply the correct url. Once you've added all the pallets, choose _Continue_

### Summary

Review the installation parameters and click _Finish_ to start the install.

![frontend_install_vbox_14](images/frontend/frontend_install_vbox_14.png)

If this was a new frontend installation, the frontend will now format
its filesystems and copy the pallets from the DVD onto its hard disk.
Next, it will install all the packages and then run post configuration
scripts. When this completes, the frontend will reboot.

Check to make sure you have what you think you have:

You should see one host:

```
# stack list host
HOST     RACK RANK APPLIANCE OS     BOX      ENVIRONMENT OSACTION INSTALLACTION COMMENT
stacki50 0    0    frontend  redhat frontend ----------- default  default       -------
```

And you should see two pallets:

```
# stack list pallet
NAME   VERSION RELEASE ARCH   OS     BOXES
stacki 5.4     redhat7 x86_64 redhat default frontend
CentOS 7       redhat7 x86_64 redhat default frontend
```

Your Stacki frontend is now ready to [install backend servers](Backend-Installation).
